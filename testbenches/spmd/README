This folder hosts C programs for testing the tile array. We use single program, multiple data (SPMD) 
technique for writing test programs.

CONTENTS:

common/: support code for compiling test programs

<spmd>/: separate folder for each test program containing
         -- code for the test program

         -- spmd.mk (eg. hello/spmd.mk)             
             - lists all the required sources; makefile in the top dir. has rules to 
               generate object files from these sources.
                                                                                       
             - contains a rule to generate the elf-binary <spmd>.riscv linking object 
               files generated from listed sources.
                                                                                       
             - contains a rule for running verilog simulation of tile array with <spmd>. 
               The target name should be in the form <simulator>_spmd.<spmd>. Makefile 
               in the top dir. has rules for generating hex file and ROM required by 
               this target.
             
             - contains simulation parameters: MAX_CYCLES, XTILES, YTILES and MEM_SIZE
                 MAX_CYCLES: maximum number of simulation cycles before timeout

                 XTILES & YTILES: dimensions of tile array to be instantiated for simulation

                 MEM_SIZE: Main makefile generates hex files of size 128k from <spmd>.riscv.
                           Redundant memory is filled with zeros. By setting this parameter to
                           a sufficient value the size of memory loaded by the test module can
                           be controlled. This parameter considerably effects the simulation
                           time.
